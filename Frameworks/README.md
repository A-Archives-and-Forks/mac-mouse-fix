- If you update or refactor Sparkle, make sure to update the `generate_appcasts.py` script. It's hardcoded to reference `Frameworks/Sparkle-1.26.0`
- In the main branches (master and feature-remap currently), I use Sparkle.framework, which is derived from the Sparkle-1.26.0 folder in this branch. It might be good to keep them in sync.
