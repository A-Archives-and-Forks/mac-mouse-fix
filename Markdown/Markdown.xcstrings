With a simple swipe on your trackpad, it lets you position any window so it takes up half, a quarter, or the whole screen.\n\nSwish is designed for trackpad gestures, but with Mac Mouse Fix you can use it from any third-party mouse! Just go to Mac Mouse Fix and set any buttons \"Click and Drag\" action to \"Scroll & Navigate\" and then you can snap windows with a simple Click and Drag.\n\nAnything you can do with a two-finger swipe on an Apple trackpad works just as well with the \"Scroll & Navigate\" feature in Mac Mouse Fix."
