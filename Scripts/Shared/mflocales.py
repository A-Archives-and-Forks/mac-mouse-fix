def get_localizable_strings_from_markdown(md_string: str) -> list[tuple[str, str, str, str]]:

    """
    Returns a list of localizable strings extracted from the `md_string`.
    
    Each tuple in the list has the structure (key, value, comment, full_match)
        key: 
            a.key.that identifies the string across different languages
        value: 
            The user-facing string in the development language (english). The goal is to translate this string into differnt languages.
        comment: 
            A comment providing context for translators.
        full_match: 
            The entire substring of the .md file that we extracted the key, value, and comment from. Replace all full_matches with translated strings to localize the .md file.
    
    The localizable strings inside the .md file can be specified in 2 ways: Using the `inline syntax` or the `block syntax`.
    
    The `inline sytax` follows the pattern:
    
        {{value||key||comment}}
        
        Examples:

            bla blah {{ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgements||acknowledgements.title||This is the title for the acknowledgements document!}}
            
            blubb
            
            bli blubb {{ðŸ˜” Roasting of Enemies||roast.title||This is the title for the roasting of enemies document!}} blah
    
    The `block syntax` follows the pattern:

        ```
        key: <key>
        ```
        <value>
        ```
        comment: <comment>
        ```
        
        Example:
        
            ```
            key: acknowledgements.body
            ```
            Big thanks to everyone using Mac Mouse Fix.

            I want to especially thank the people and projects named in this document.
            ```
            comment: This is the intro for the acknowledgements document
            ```
            

    Keep in mind!
    
        For the `block_syntax`, any free lines directly above or below the <value> will be ignored and removed. 
        
        So it doesn't make any difference whether the markdown source looks like this:

            ```
            key: <key>
            ```
            abcefghijklmnop
            qrstuvwxyz
            ```
            comment: <comment>
            ```
        
        Or like this:
            
            ```
            key: <key>
            ```
            
            
            
            abcefghijklmnop
            qrstuvwxyz
            
            
            
            ```
            comment: <comment>
            ```
        
        -> I tried to respect the free lines around the <value>, but I couldn't ge the regex to work like that. But honestly, it's probably better this way. 
            Since, this way, translators will never have to add blank lines above or below their content to make the layout of the .md file work as intended.
            
    Notes:
    - Use https://regex101.com to design and test regexes like the ones used here.
    - To test, you might want to post the whole .md file on regex101. That way you can see any under or overmatching which might not be obvious when testing a smaller example string.
